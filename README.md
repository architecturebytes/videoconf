We are using plain Javascript without any frameworks like ReactJS etc.

**Generate Amazon Chime SDK Javascript Client Library - single file** <br>

git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk.git <br>

Here make sure that src/index.js looks like this (update it if necessary): <br>
export * as default from 'amazon-chime-sdk-js';

npm install <br>
npm run bundle

This will generate amazon-chime-sdk.min.js in build directory.

**Lambda function** <br>

Make sure that the **chime.endpoint** region is correct here.

**NOTE: Amazon Chime SDK Endpoint has changed!** <br>
The endpoint is used in the Lambda function. <br>

Earlier there was a global endpoint (which is being deprecated): <br>
https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com 

New regional endpoints are of the form (new customers must use these): <br>
https://meetings-chime.[RegionHere].amazonaws.com <br>
For eg:<br>
https://meetings-chime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
